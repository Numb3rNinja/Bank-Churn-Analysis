# Project Background
In the highly competitive banking industry, customer retention is crucial to maintaining profitability and growth. With increasing customer expectations, rising competition from digital banks, and evolving financial needs, understanding why customers leave has become a strategic imperative.

This Bank Churn Analysis project was initiated to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to customer attrition. By analyzing demographic trends, behavioral patterns, and financial metrics, the goal was to identify high-risk segments, uncover hidden insights, and inform strategic decision-making. Ultimately, the project aims to empower the bank to proactively address churn, enhance customer loyalty, and foster long-term relationships through targeted initiatives and customer-centric strategies.
